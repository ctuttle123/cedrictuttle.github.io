# Hi, I'm Cedric Tuttle

🎓 **Economics & Data Science Senior at Carnegie Mellon University**  
📊 Currently a **Business Insights Analyst at Amica Insurance**  

I’m passionate about using data to drive strategic decisions, build predictive models, and uncover insights that support innovation and initiative.
I love learning about new platforms and tools that can enhance my productivity while also improving efficieny.
I have made this page so you can get a better idea of who I am! I have a few of my favorite projects you can check out at the projects page. I Love sports so I have projects arround the NBA, NFL and F1.
My interest in data science really started with the movie Moneyball, I rememebre watching the movie at a young age and being amazed at what could be accomplised with data. We don't always have the ressources 
to make up for ineffeciency and Data Analysis can help accomplish more with more limited ressources which is true in sports but can also be applied to every single industry! I have also tackled projects 
arround Insurance claims and Investments strategies to show the applications of my data skills in fields beyond sports!
